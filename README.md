# Graphene
Calculating electronic transport properties of bilayer graphene


## Getting started

### Figures
To plot all the figures related to electronic transport in bilayer graphene run this function in MATLAB:
```
plot_figures_transport()
```
The figures will show up as `.pdf` files in the same directory.
